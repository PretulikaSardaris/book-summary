        A habit is a routine or behavior that is performed regularly.
         We all face challenges in life.<br>
         Quality of our lives depend of quality of our habits.

        <li><strong>Chapter 1

            <span>The Surprising Power of Atomic Habits.</span></strong>  <br>
            Very often we try to convince us that massive success needs massive actions. 
            <br>Improving by 1% is not measurable, but it makes impact long term. Habits are compound interest of self-improvement.  
            <br>When we repeat 1% of mistake day by day, it leads to a problem. Habits are double edged sword – 
            they can either work for you or against you. Success is a product of daily habits.
            <br> You get what you repeat. Plateau of latent potential – if you cannot build a good new habit or break an old bad habit, its because you haven’t crossed this plateau. The results don’t come linear to efforts. Previous efforts come into positive results always late. We need to focus on system. Goals are required for setting direction, system is required for making a progress.  

            General problems we face: Winners and losers have same goals. 
           <br> Achieving a goal is only momentary and it only changes your life for short time. <br>
            You need to solve problems at systems level. After achieving a goal you come back to old habits. Bad habits keep on repeating as they become part of the system.  
            
            Atomic habit is a small part of the system.  </li>
        <li>
          <strong>Chapter 2 - Your habits shape your identity </strong>

          Our first mistake is we often try to change wrong thing - that’s why we cannot break bad habits. Change can occur at 3 layers – 1. change in outcome: goals (how you thing), change in your process: habits (what you do) and change in your identity: what you believe.   
          
          We have to target identity based habits. Habits shall become part of your identity. We are continuously going through micro-evolution. Habits are path to changing your identity. Two step process: 1. define the type of person you want to be; what do you want to stand for, your values etc. 2. prove yourself – make yourself believe/edit your beliefs.    
        </li>

          <strong>Chapter 3- How to Build Better Habits in four steps. </strong>

          Why brain build habits – you keep on trying to see how things works. You keep on exploring till you reach a reward. Try - fail – learn – we keep on doing it lifetime. We try to automate things. Habits are reliable solutions for us. We don’t analyze each situation.  Habit is just a memory – what solution you tried in past to solve a problem. Habits reduce cognitive load. Habits don’t restrict freedom – they create it actually freedom. You need good learning habits.  
          
          How habits work: four steps which are backbone of habits 1.  Cue – (observing the reward) we learn cues where we get reward – you learn where you get what, it motivates craving, 2. Craving – (wanting the reward) without craving we don’t have reason to act, it is different for each person, so they don’t have same cues too, it motivates response 3. Response – (acting for reward) your response depends on your ability and it leads to reward. 4. Reward – (obtaining the reward) response delivers reward.  
          
          Your brain is reward detector. Rewards complete feedback loop and it turns into habits. If reward is not sufficient, it will not turn in habit. Making habit is feedback loop of 4 steps.  
          
          Problem phase: cue and craving & solution phase – response and reward. 
          
          Four laws of behavior change. 1. Cue make it obvious 2. Craving – make it attractive 3. resonse make it easy. 4. Reward – make it satisfying; inversion of these laws can change behavior to stop bad habit – no inversion for developing good habits.

          <strong>Chapter 4 -</strong>  

          Your body can handle many things on auto pilot. You have variety of feedback loops and form various habits. We need to start the process of behavior change.  
          
          Habits scorecard – make a list of all your daily habits. Ask yourself which are good habits, which are neutral habits, which are bad habits. You can categorize your habits depending on where you are heading too e.g. reducing weight, or concentrated working or relationship development etc. Goal is to simply notice what is going on in your life. The process of behavior change starts with awareness.    
        </li>
        <li>
          <strong>Chapter 5 -  best way to start a new habit </strong>  

          Follow your predetermined plan. Make a plan what you will do when. If we have hope – we have a reason to take action. You often decide to do something as next work depending what you just finished. You have to use connectedness of things you do to build new habits. E.g. you can go for mediation after a cup of tea. Stack a new habit on old one. E.g. in morning after you pour a cup of tea – do mediation for 1 min and then write a to do list for the day. I will take more vegetables on plate when I will eat or when in social circle, I will introduce myself to atleast one new person. Be careful to add a habit which is also occupiable (time, occasion, location and efforts).  
          
          Make a list of daily habits where you don’t fail e.g. shower or coffee brewing, add new habits to those. First step to behavioral change is to make it obvious.

          <strong>Chapter 6 - Motivation Is Overrated, Environment Often Matters More </strong>  

          Environment shapes human behavior. Visual cues are most important for humans. You don’t have to be victim of your environment – you can also use it as architect. Things which are hidden do not form a cue. Hence use visual powers to make a cue of things where you want to grow your habits. Redesign your environment as per necessity. Habits are easily formed in new environment – because you are not fighting with old cues. Take different options to create new environment. Try new grocery store to create new healthy food habits. Rearrange room where you work. Also in limited spaces you can try to rearrange in such a way that each thing is associated with particular habit.    
        </li>
        <li>
          <strong>Chapter 7 - The secret to self-control </strong>  

          Addictions can readily be changed if there is sudden big change in environment. When context change – so does the habit. It is important to create disciplined environment. Bad habits are autocatalytic. When you don’t have energy, you continue with bad habits. cue-induced wanting: external triggers cause  compulsive craving to repeat a bad habit.  Make cues of good habits obvious and bad habits invisible. Self control is short term strategy and long term one.  
        </li>
        <li>
          <strong>Chapter 8 - How to make habit irresistible? </strong>  

          Make it attractive –if opportunity is attractive then the habit can be easily formed. As per history –opportunities in future will be more attractive. Our goal is how to make a habit irresistible.  
          
          Habits are dopamine driven feedback loop e.g. browsing social media or interacting socially etc. Dopamine is released also when you anticipate pleasure. When you realize, your opportunity will lead to reward – dopamine level goes up.  Daydreaming of holiday can be more joyful than being in real holiday. Temptation bundling concept to make habit attractive: mean try to combine two things. Actions which need to be done with actions you want to do.

          <strong>Chapter 9 - The Role of Family and Friends in Shaping Your Habits  </strong>

          Habits which are normal in your culture – those become your obvious habits. Imitating the Close – it means we pick up habits from the people around us e.g. how our parents negotiate. Culture sets your expectation to what is normal. Imitating the Many: in uncertain times we take behavior from group of people around us e.g. we try to read review on amazon.  Imitation the Powerful: we want to be acknowledged or praised. We are drawn to behaviors for which we get respect or get admired. If a behavior can get us approval, respect, and praise, we find it attractive. We avoid behaviors that would lower our status.    
        </li>

          <strong>Chapter 10 -How to Find and Fix the Causes of Your Bad Habits </strong>

          How can you get rid of bad habits – make it unattractive. Every behavior has surface level craving deeper underlying motive. The underlying motives for humans remain same (ancient time or also modern time). Habits are all about associations. Our behavior is highly dependent on how we interpretate situations. Same cue might mean different interpretation for two friends. Craving is a sense that something is missing. So, you take the actions. Desire is different between where you are now and what you want to be. When emotions and feeling are despaired – you cannot make decisions. Habits are attractive when we associate with positive experiences. We only need a small mind shift. Reframe your good habits to positive outcome. Take three breath and smile – say I am happy, sad about life/things – take 3 breath and smile. Highlight the benefits of avoiding bad habits. This shall make them unattractive.

          <strong>Chapter 11 - Walk slowly but never backward </strong>

          Motions makes you feel that things are getting done. Third law: You don’t want only to plan – you want to be practicing. More you repeat activity – more it gets automated. Each repetition makes you neurons to get trained (they can perform with ease). Repetitive actions can form habits. What matters is a rate at which you repeat things. Frequency matters. What matters is that you take action. To build habit you need to practice it continuously. There is no general answer how long it takes to make a habit.   
        </li>
        <li><strong>Chapter 12 -The law of least effort </strong>

          Our main motivation is to be lazy and do things which are convenient. We follow route of least effort. We are motivated to do things which are easy. Less energy a habit takes, easier it can form a routine. Make your habits as convenient as possible. It does not mean only to do easy things. Do things in easier way to get reward in long term. Practice environment design to make actions easier. Don’t try building habit in friction environment. Remove points of friction to achieve more. When friction goes down habits can be formed easily. Do opposite (increase friction) for bad habits.  </li>
        <li>
          <strong>Chapter 13 - How to stop procrastinating by using 2 min rule </strong>

          40-50 actions per day are due to our habit. Habits influence our conscious actions. We need to master decisive moments. Decisive moments can let habits win and then you have limited options.  
          
          2 min rule – when you start new habit, it shall take 2 min only. Make your habit as easy as possible. New habit shall not seem like a challenge. Habit must be established before it can be improved. You have to standardize before you can optimize. Real goal is to make it more than 2 mins – this comes automatically afterwards as you keep on practicing your habit for 2 mins. With habit of 2 mins you create a new identity.   
        </li>
        <li>
          <strong>Chapter 14 -How to make hood habits inevitable and bad habits impossible </strong>

          You have to make few things difficult. Commitment device: in present try to lock yourself to future good habits. E.g. tell the waiter to pack your food half to take home. Use technology to implement your plan (e.g. keep mobile to silent, delete social media apps). You spend approx. 2 hrs per day on social media – get a partner to reset your password which is only shared with you on the weekend. You can improve productivity during the week.    
        </li>
        <li>
          <strong>Chapter 15 -The cardinal rule of behavior change </strong>

          We repeat behavior if outcome is satisfying.  That’s the reason why we change e.g. toothpaste or some of our choices. What is rewarded is repeated? Positive emotions cultivate habits n vice versa. We are generally looking for immediate satisfaction. World has changed a lot recently, but human nature has not. Our brain looks for quick payoffs. Every habit produces multiple outcomes over time. The costs of good habits are in present, costs of bad habits are in future. Question if something gives you immediate award if it is good for your long term plan. Immediate reward at the same time is important to start any habit. For starting any habit you need to feel immediately successful—even if it’s in a small way. A habit needs to be enjoyable in order it to last.   
        </li>
        <li><strong>Chapter 16 -How to stick with good habits every day </strong>

          Measure your behavior via habit tracker. Write your progress in booklet. Benefits of habit tracking: 1. Habit tracking is obvious – one habit tracking can kick off the next one as a sequence.  Habit tracking makes you honest – you notice what is going on each day. 2. Habit tracking is attractive – addictive effect on motivation.  3. Habit tracking is satisfying. Most important benefit. You are focused on system than only the goal. There is no need to track everything – do it for most important thing. Measurement should be automatic. Manual tracking only for most important habits – start with one only. How to recover if habit breaks down? Note: perfection is not possible. There will be a break. Remember a rule: never miss twice; means it is you if you miss once, don’t miss second chance. Missing second means you start with new habit. Lost days hurt you more. When you go for habit tracker, be carefully to track correct habit and with correct measure. Habit tracking makes habits satisfying – it gives you a feeling of progressing.  </li>
        <li><strong>Chapter 17 - How an accountability partner changes everything </strong>

          Where consequences are severe, we learn quicker. Increase the speed of punishment associated with behavior. You can create habit contract. Find 1-2 people as accountability partner. Accountability partner is useful – if you don’t follow – you may fail in front of accountability partner, which you want to avoid. We care opinions of people around us e.g. accountability partner. We are unlikely to follow a habit if it is unsatisfying.   </li>
        <li><strong>Chapter 18 -The truth about talent </strong>

          Chose right field of competition. You want to play a game in which odds are in your favor. The key is to focus where you get excitement, and you have skills. Understand your personality. Your genes play an important role. Our habits are affected by our personalities and our genes. But as genes cannot be changed, they can also be considered as strength. Chose habit that fits you and not one which is popular. Tailoring habits to your personality is good start but not the end. How to pick a habit – it must be easy to start. Try out many possibilities than trial and error – keep experimenting till you find correct settings. Remember - we all have limited time on this planet. Work hard on the things which come easy.  </li>
        <li><strong>Chapter 19 - The goldilocks rule – how to stay motivated </strong>

          Always improve in small steps, keep it as simple as possible, advance in small ways, keep old things which are working well. Without variety we get bored. We need to keep the variety. What best athlets can do – they handle their boredom and overcome it. We lose motivation when we get bored. Practice is important but it can also lead to boredom. If we get bored we look for new strategy though old strategies were working.  On the journey to self improvement – you have to fall in love with your boredom. If the habit is important for you, then you shall be able to stick to it with any mood. Important is the ability to keep going.  </li>
        <li><strong>Chapter 20- The downside of creating new good habit </strong>

          You need automatic habits and deliberate practice. Once a new habit is formed, you have to start focusing on new habit building. Sometimes however we forget that we start making errors when new habits are formed. Establish a system for reflection and review.  Reflect on your identity. Make a report each 6 months. Which mistakes you did – what are your core values – are you in line with the identity with you want to be. You will recognize that you made mistakes (which is okay) and then you will be motivated to take corrective options. Reflection and review helps for behavior change – especially towards your identity. Keep your identity small.  
          
          Can one coin make you rich? No. Can one habit make you change / transform your life? No. That’s the principle of atomic habits. One positive change will not make difference, it is small changes on the top of one another. Atomic habits don’t add, they lead to compound effect. If you are not successful, it is not you, it is your system which needs to be changed. Success is not to reach finish line, it’s a process to change your system. Principle is: make it obvious, attractive, easy and sastisfying for good habits you want to implant in you. Exactly opposite you have to do for habits you want to get rid of. Never stop making improvements.   </li>
